#Lets perform arithmetic operations on the variable
print("Add 10 to X")
print(x + 10)

#task: perform Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus,floor division, exponent
print("Subtract 10 from X", x - 10)
print("Divide 10 from X", x/10)
print("Multiply 10 to X", x * 10)
print("Modulus 10 to X", x % 10)
print("Floor division 3 to X", x//3)
