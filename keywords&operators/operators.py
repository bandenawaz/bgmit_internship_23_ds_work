'''
Operators:
        Operators are used to perform operations on the variables
        and values, or operands.
        These are used to solve an expression.

    List of operators:
        1. Arithmetic operators:
            These operator are used with numerical values
            to perform common mathematical operations
'''
# +: This is an addition operator used to perform addition 
# between two variables or values or operands.
print(5 + 3)

#task: perform -,*,/,//,%,**

'''
Comparison operators:
    Comparison operators are used to compare two or more operands
    or values. It works well with all the data types in Python and
    returns either True or False.
'''
#let define few variables
a = 5
b = 3
x = 5
y = 8

# == : This is used to compare two variables and values whether they
# are equal or not.
print(a == x)
print(b == y)

#task: perform !=, <,>, <=, >=

'''
Logical Operators:
    These operators are used to compare two or more conditional
    statements or expressions and returns the boolean value
'''
#and: This operator is used to compare multiple conditional statements
#and returns True if all the statements are true, False otherwise.
print(8 == 8 and a == x)

#task: perform or, not

'''
Assignment Operator:
    These operators are used to assign values to the 
    operands or variables
'''
#=: This will assign the value on its right side to the operand
#on its left side
f = 9
g = 8

#+= : This operator adds to the operand on the right side with 
#the operand on the left side and assigns the result back to same 
# #operand on the left side
f += 2
print(f) 

#task: perform -=,*=,/=,%=,**=,//=
